### TLB Process
- Check if the page entry is available in cache
- If it is, "TLB Hit" -> make sure it's valid - access it
- If it's not, "TLB Miss" -> check the page table to find the physical page -> add entry inside TLB -> access it

### TLB Accesses
- Per-process
- Invalidate TLB entries if another process tries to access the same entry

### Workload Access Patterns
#### Spatial Locality
- Sequentially access the information

#### Temporal Locality
- Repeated Random access
- Same information will be access after a certain period of time

### TLB Replacement Policies
#### LRU Cache
- Evicting the least recently used item

Issues:
- Cyclic access causes the LRU to keep missing after the first cycle

### TLB with ASID
- Adds another column in the page table to seperate processes

### HW and OS Roles
If HW handles (it does irl) TLB Miss
- CPU must know where pagetables are
    - CR3 registers in x86
    - Pagetable structure is fixed and agreed upon between the OS and HW
    - HW "walks" the pagetable and fills the TLB

### TLB Summary
- Accessing page tables for every memory access is slow
- TLB performance depends on workload

### Multi-level Page Tables
- Allow page tables to be allocated non-contiguously
- Page the page tables

In a 20-bit address:
- 4 Highest Order bits -> Outer Page
- 4 Second-highest Order bits -> Inner Page
- Rest 12 bits -> Page Offset

- Each process has a Page Directory and it's own multi-level page table
