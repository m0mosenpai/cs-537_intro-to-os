### Pages
Goal:
- Eliminate requirement that address space is contiguous
- Eliminate external fragmentation
- Grow segments as needed

Divide address space into fixed-size pages

### Virtual -> Physical Page Mapping
- Number of bits need virtual address and physical address need not be equal

### Page Tables
- Exists per-process
- Some permission bits
- Each entry is called "Page Table Entry"
- Stored in the kernel space of the memory
- CR3 on x86 is the page table base register
- Change contents of CR3 based on current scheduled process

### Memory Access with Page Tables

### Pros/ Cons of Paging
#### Pros
- No external fragmentation
- Fast to allocate and free

#### Cons
- Additional memory reference
- Storage for page tables may not be continguous
