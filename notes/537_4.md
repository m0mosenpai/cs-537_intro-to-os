## Memory Virtualization

### Multiprogramming Goals
- Transparency (Simplify/ Abstract away the details from the program)
- Protection (Should not corrupt the OS or other process memory)
- Efficiency (Should not waste memory slow down processes)
- Sharing (Should be able to share between cooperating processes)

### Abstraction: Address Space
Code, Heap -> free <- Stack (Heap grows downwards, Stack grows upwards)

### Creation of a process
1. _fork()_
- Clones the calling process to create a child process
- Copy of code, data, stack etc. is made
- New process is scheduled by adding to the ready list

2. _exec()_
- Replaces the current process with the new process
