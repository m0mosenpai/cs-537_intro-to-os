### 3. Dynamic Relocation
Goal: Protecting processes from one another

We introduce a hardware middle box - Memory Management Unit (MMU)
- Dynamically changes process address at every memory reference
- Process generates virtual address, MMU generated hardware (real) address

#### Process
User Mode:
- Translate logical address to physical address (via MMU)

Kernel Mode:
- Manipulate MMU
- Access all of the physical memory

#### Implemention
Logical Address ->
if user mode ? (switch to kernel mode) add base : (already privileged) continue ->
Physical Address

This still doesn't guarantee security! (One process can overwrite values of another process)

### 4. Dynamic with Base + Bounds
Goal: Limit the address with a bounds register

Base: Smallest physical address (Starting point of the memory)
Bounds: Specifies the range

#### Implemenation
Logical Address ->
if user mode ? [ switch to kernel mode ] (if address within bounds ? add base) : (already privileged) continue ->
Physical Address

#### Limitations
- Entire address space needs to be contiguous in nature

### 5. Segmentation
Goal: Divide address space into logical segments. Each segment has separate base + bounds
- Each segment has a separate base + bounds register

#### Implementation
- Splitting the virtual/ logical address into 2 parts:
    1. Higher bits are the address
    2. Lower bits are the segment (offset within memory)

- MMU contains the "Segment Table" (per process)
    - Each segment has own base and bounds, protection bits
    - Eg: 14 bit logical addresses, 4 segments

Approaching such problems:
1. How many bits for the segment? -> Take log (base 2) of the number of segments
2. How many bits for offset? -> Number of logical addresses - Bits for each segment

Segment Numbers (in decimal):
    0: code + data
    1: heap
    2: stack

**_The stack grows upwards (in decreasing memory address space) - hence, offset calculated will always be negative_**

#### Advantage
- Enables sparse location of address space
- Stack and Heap grow independently
    1. Heap: If no more memory in free space, request OS for more
    2. Stack: OS recognizes reference outside legal segment, extends stack implicitly

#### Disadvantage
- Each Segment must be allocated contiguously
- May leave empty spaces within memory not sufficiently large for another process (hence, wasted memory)
- Doesn't really have efficieny guarantees
