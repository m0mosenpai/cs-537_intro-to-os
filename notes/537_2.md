### Processes
Stream of executing instructions and their context

### Sharing CPU
- Time Sharing -> One process is given exclusive access to the CPU for a fixed time duration
- When the process is not running -> save the eip in process context to later recover and resume execution
- State Transitions (Running <-> Ready <- Blocked <- Running)
- Mark slow processes that the program depends on as "blocked" so it is not considered for scheduling
- If the CPU is dealing with 2 processes and one of them is in the "Blocked" state, the other process is shifted directly
to the run state since the CPU is free so the Blocked -> Ready -> Running transition all happens in one go (_OSTEP Homeworks!!_)

### Sharing Policies
- Privilege Levels -> User Mode and Kernel Mode (Super mode! Only for the OS)
- There needs to be some form of communication between the two modes -> System Calls!

### System Calls
- User mode P can only see it's own memory because of it's mode policy - Kernel is hidden
- $6 (read) is stored in %eax and $64 interrupt is raised - this number is used to jump into the syscall handler
- Kernal can access user memory and write the data that was fetched from disk (in this example)

### Dispatch/ Scheduler Loop
- switches/schedules processes as and when needed
- Time Based Interrupts -> Guarantees that the OS can obtain control periodically

1. [Hardware] Timer Interuupt: saves registers of process A in kernel stack and jumps to interrupt handler
2. [OS] Trap Interrupt:
