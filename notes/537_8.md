### x86-64
- Virtual Address: 48 bits
    - Upper 16 bits are sign extended(all 0, all 1)
- Physical Address: 48 bits

4 levels of page tables

### Inverted Page Table
- Find possible matches entries by hashing vpn+asid
- Use chaining to handle collisions
- This requires software-controlled TLB
- TLB misses are expensive
**Not being used these days**

### Effect of Page Size
- Change of TLB Hit: (Size of TLB / Number of Pages)
- Large pages reduces the chance for TLB misses

### Translating Huge Pages
- 2MB Pages
- 21 bits for offset
- 9 bit 3 level memory access

### Sharing Page Tables
- Physical page appears in both process' address spaces

#### Uses
- Kernel data mapped to each process
- Different processes running the same binary
- User-level system libraries
- Shared pages as IPC
